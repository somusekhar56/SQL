# 1 Relational Database Basics:
# 1.1 Database
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily stored, accessed, and managed.
For example, an online shopping site stores:
* Customer data
* Product details
* Orders and payments
  All of these are stored in a database.
 # 1.2 Relational Database:
 A Relational Database (RDB) stores data in the form of tables (relations).
* Each table consists of:
  * Rows (records): each row represents one item (e.g., one customer)
  * Columns (fields): each column represents one attribute (e.g., customer name, ID).
  The term “relational” comes from how data in one table relates to data in another.
# 2 Database Management System (DBMS)
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that helps store, organize, manage, and retrieve data efficiently from a database.
A DBMS acts as a bridge between the user and the database.
